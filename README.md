#### iFitness

> A RESTful service for managing gym memberships and billing structures.

#### Overview

Fitness+ offers gym memberships with various billing structures. Some memberships are annual with a single upfront payment, while others have monthly dues. Additionally, members can subscribe to optional add-on services (personal training sessions, towel rentals) with separate monthly charges. Here's the twist:

- For new members, the first invoice combines the annual membership fee with the first month's charges for any add-on services they choose.

- In subsequent months, only the monthly charges for the add-on services are billed.

#### Task

Develop a backend system that implements the following functionalities based on your expertise in these frameworks to build a robust and scalable backend API. Consider Nest.js, Postgresql, well-documented RESTful APIs and you can use your Gmail SMTP server to send out the mails.

1. Data Model:

- Design a data model to store information about gym memberships, including:

  - Membership ID (unique identifier)
  - First Name
  - Last Name
  - Membership type (e.g., Annual Basic, Monthly Premium)
  - Start date
  - Due date (for annual memberships) or monthly due date (for add-on services)
  - Total amount (for annual memberships) or monthly amount (for add-on services)
  - Member email address
  - IsFirstMonth (boolean flag indicating if it's the first month of the membership)
  - (_Optional_) Link to the detailed membership invoice

2. Cron Job Implementation:

- Develop a cron job that will run periodically (e.g., daily) to check for upcoming membership fees.

- The cron job should:

  - Query the database for memberships with upcoming due dates.

  - Differentiate between annual memberships and add-on services,
    considering the `isFirstMonth` flag.

  - For new members (first month):

    - Calculate the reminder date (e.g., `7` days before the due date) based on the annual membership due date.

    - Send an email reminder with the membership type, total amount for the combined annual fee and first month's add-on service charges, and a link to the full invoice detailing both.

  - For existing members (subsequent months):

    - Check if the current date falls within the month for which the
      add-on service applies.

    - If yes, send an email reminder with the service name, monthly
      amount, and a link to the invoice for that specific month's
      add-on service charge.

3. Email Functionality:

   - Implement a mechanism to send email reminders using an email service provider (ESP) or a local mail server (your choice).

   - The email should contain:

     - Subject: Fitness+ Membership Reminder - [Membership Type]

     - Body: A message reminding the member about the upcoming
       payment, including the membership details (type, due date for annual or month for add-on services), and a link to the relevant invoice. Clearly differentiate between the first month's combined invoice and subsequent month's add-on service invoices in the message.

#### Project Structure

Overall, the project is designed to be scalable, maintainable and extensible. The use of a modular monolithic architecture, where all key features are modularized. This can easily spin off to a micro-service that easily promotes code organization and separation of concerns.
